Over the past few months, with the help and support of my mentors from the Power Foundation Mentorship Program, I have been working on "whoami?" - a game where you take on the role of a former master hacker who's slowly piecing together his memories after a horrible accident.

The game is built in Godot Engine, and focuses on simulating real penetration testing techniques and vulnerabilities.
You can check out the game's repository on my LinkedIn page.
