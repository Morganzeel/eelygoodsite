Over the past few months, with the help and support of my mentors from the Power Foundation Mentorship Program, I have been working on "whoami?" - a game where you take on the role of a former master hacker who's slowly piecing together his memories after a horrible accident.

The game is built in Godot Engine, and focuses on simulating real penetration testing techniques and vulnerabilities.\
You can check out the game's repository on my Github page.\
I owe a big 'Thank You' to my mentors Edin and Fikret for keeping me motivated and guiding me through the development of this project.
